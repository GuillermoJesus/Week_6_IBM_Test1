# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# Some of the key takeaways from the course
# 
# **Objectives:**
# * Popular Lenguajes in DS
# * Common Libraries used in DS
# * Examples of arithmetics expression in Python
# 
#     
#     

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# * Python
# * R
# * SQL

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# 
# a = 5
# b = 3
# suma = a + b
# print(suma)
# 
# 
# c = 1
# d = 34
# resta = x - y
# print(resta)
# 
# e = 9
# f = 2
# multiplicacion = p * q
# print(multiplicacion)
# 

# In[4]:


(3*4)+5


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

# In[5]:


segundos = 200
horas = segundos / 3600
print(horas)


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
